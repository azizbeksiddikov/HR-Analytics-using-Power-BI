# HR-Analytics-using-Power-BI

In this project, I built an attractive and eye-catching HR dashboard using Power BI. 
I began this project by importing data & creating an employee demographics page that gives the overall demographic outlook of the organization. 
Then I created pie charts and doughnut charts to visualize gender & racial diversity. 
In the final tasks, I created an employee detail page that will provide us with all the important information about any employee with just a click. 
I also added buttons, themes, slicers & filters to make the dashboard more interactive & useful.
